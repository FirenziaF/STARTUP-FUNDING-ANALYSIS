# **Introduction.**
In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, the allure of founding a startup with a groundbreaking idea has captivated the imagination of many aspiring entrepreneurs. However, without a firm grasp of the past and insights from previous startup experiences, venturing into this exhilarating journey can be perilous. The dataset used in this kernel provides a unique opportunity to delve into the world of startups and gain a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics, challenges, and triumphs.


# **Problem Statement.**
Despite the rapid growth of the startup scene and the increasing investments from venture capital firms, understanding the dynamics and characteristics of these newly established firms remains a challenge. The chosen dataset provides a valuable glimpse into this captivating realm, presenting an opportunity to delve deeper and unravel the underlying trends and patterns within the startup ecosystem.


# **Project Objectives.**
**Identify Key Success Factors:** Analyze startup success variables by examining common traits, techniques, and patterns.

**Optimize Funding Strategies:** Explore diverse fundraising patterns and sources to increase startup funding success and amount.

**Mitigate Risks and Challenges:** Develop techniques to alleviate startup challenges to boost resilience, survival, and growth.

**Identify Market Opportunities:** Analyze industry sectors, market trends, and emerging niches to find market penetration and development possibilities.

**Enhance Decision-Making:** Optimize market entrance, resource allocation, and strategic relationships using data-driven insights. 

# **Metric for Success.**
The project's success criterion is to identify a model with the highest accuracy. The desired accuracy level for success is set at 80%.

# **Dataset description.**
The dataset used for training the machine learning model contains investment data about startup companies, sourced from Crunchbase, a prominent website for company insights ranging from early-stage startups to Fortune 1000 companies. The dataset comprises approximately 54,000 rows and 39 columns. 

# **Data Preparation.**
This phase involved engaging in data cleaning and transformation, organization of raw data as well as exploratory data analysis (EDA)  to uncover patterns, anomalies, and valuable insights.

# **Modelling.**

The dataset was divided into two sets: the training dataset and the test dataset. The baseline model was established by employing a Random Forest. Additionally, the following datasets were used:

-Decision Tree.

-XGBoosting.

-ADABoosting.

# **Model Evaluation.**
The model selection was based on the following criteria:

 -Model Train and Test Accuracy.
 
 -Cross Validation Accuracy.
 
 -Log Loss.
